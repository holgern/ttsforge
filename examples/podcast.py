Podcast-style multi-voice conversation example using ttsforge.

This example demonstrates how to create a podcast with multiple speakers
using different voices. Each speaker has their own voice and the conversation
flows naturally with random pauses between lines.

Usage:
    python examples/podcast.py

Output:
    podcast_demo.wav - A multi-voice podcast conversation
